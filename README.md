# workoutlog


## Background
This is a project I started at the end of this summer. It's basically practice and review of all the things I learned from the android docs. I'm also using it as my senior project.
I'm hoping to incorporate use of Room, Retrofit, RXjava and some Jetpack libraries.

## The app

this is an android app that will help keep track of workouts and encourage progress. It should be as simple as possible.
